### 4.1 OBJECTIVE

Write a C program to simulate the following file allocation strategies.

a) Sequential(Contiguous) b) Linked c) Indexed

### 4.2 RESOURCE 

Ubuntu Operating system

### 4.3 PROGRAM LOGIC

The producer consumer problem is considered a classic synchronization problem because it is an example 
of a large class of concurrency-control problems. It is a simple representation of the need to allocate several 
resources among several processes in a deadlock-free and starvation-free manner. Producer consumer problem 
also provided solution using semaphores concept ,two operations wait() and signal() will be performed on 
counting semaphore value and lock will be acquired and release using mutex locks.So that processes will be 
synchronized properly
